# itj_design_study

Digital (and occasionally physical) design studies involving integrated timber joints (itj) using the clamp assembly strategy developed in the PhD project [Robotic Assembled Timber Structures with Integral Timber Joints](https://github.com/gramaziokohler/phd_spatial_timber_assembly). 

## Repo folder structure and index

Architectural design files (Rhino 3D files) are organized in folders related to a specific topic of investigation. The folder naming convention is **/yymmdd_study_name** . The following list provides an index of the studies:

**(Assembly Study)** [**191101_manual_assembly_two_walls**](.\191101_manual_assembly_two_walls) 

A design to demonstrate the complexity of assembling two intersecting walls that shares a common element. 

| Physical Prototype                               | Digital Model   | AssemSim | StructuralSim | Evaluation |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Manual Joint Cutting<br />Manual Assembly (2ppl) | Modeled (Rhino) | None     | None          | Discussion |

**(Joint Detail)** [**191200_joint_guidance_strategy**](.\191200_joint_guidance_strategy) 

Design study of joint details that can assist alignment. Different joint details (e.g. mating-face tapering, edge chamfering) are modeled. 

| Physical Prototype                             | Digital Model   | AssemSim | StructuralSim | Evaluation |
